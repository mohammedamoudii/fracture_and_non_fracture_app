# Fracture & Non-Fracture Classification App

> **Educational purpose only.**  
> This project is built for learning and demonstration. The authors are not responsible for any real-world usage or decisions made using this application.

## General Idea
This project aims to **classify X-ray bone images** into:
- **Fracture**
- **Non-fracture**

We built and trained a **CNN model using PyTorch**, then deployed an interactive demo using **Streamlit**.

## Live Demo (Streamlit)
- [Fracture & Non-Fracture App](https://fractureandnonfractureapp-ay5f2krrw4xcyefeorwaft.streamlit.app/)
